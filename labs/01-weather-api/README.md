# Lab 01 — Weather API

### Scope of this first version

We will implement four endpoints:

```http
GET /
GET /health
GET /weather
GET /weather/{city}
```

They will demonstrate:

- creating a FastAPI application;
- HTTP GET operations;
- JSON responses;
- path parameters;
- query parameters;
- HTTP status codes;
- handling non-existent cities;
- automatic documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc;
- local execution;
- manual testing via browser, Swagger, PowerShell, and Postman.

FastAPI automatically distinguishes between parameters present in the path and those received in the query string. Type annotations are also used for conversion, validation, and OpenAPI contract generation.

## 1. Laboratory structure

Within the repository, we will create:

```text
api-engineering-lab/
│
├── labs/
│   └── 01-weather-api/
│       ├── app/
│       │   ├── __init__.py
│       │   ├── data.py
│       │   └── main.py
│       │
│       ├── docs/
│       │   └── images/
│       │
│       ├── .gitignore
│       ├── README.md
│       └── requirements.txt
│
└── README.md
```

For Lab 01, this structure offers a good balance: it is small enough to grasp (especially if you are a beginner following the tutorial in this repository), yet it avoids concentrating the entire project into a single file.
